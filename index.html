      <h3>Lesson One: Get Python Installed</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Python is a great first language to learn. It's simple and easy to read, but can be very powerful, and is used by some of the biggest companies in the world whether they are involved with technology or not.</li>
        <li>First, you'll need to download Python to your computer. If you don't already have it downloaded, consult the course notes in the resources section of this section.</li>
        <li>One thing you should know, is that when downloading, you should download the python 3 interpreter, so Python 3.<i>whatever the current python is at the time of reading this</i>.</li>
        <li>There are 2 possible things being referenced when the word "python" is being used. The first is the language, which is the syntax used to give your computer instructions. The seconds, is the interpreter, which for Python
          will be referred to as the IDLE window. The interpreter allows you to run python code and perform the tasks you asked your computer to complete.
        </li>
        <li>One thing to keep in mind is that programming can be complicated, and no one remeber all the things they need to remember. This leads to a lot of googling on certain topics,
            so there should be no shame in not knowing one little thing about a concept.
        </li>
        <li>If you do have an error message pop up while you're trying to run any of your code, copy and paste the error message into your preferred search engine. In all likelihood, the first few results will be from a website
          called Stack Overflow, which is a great forum for any problems you might have while coding. Always make sure to check to make sure someone with your exact problem hasn't posed the question before you post.
