        <h3>Lesson One: Get Python Installed</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Python is a great first language to learn. It's simple and easy to read, but can be very powerful, and is used by some of the biggest companies in the world whether they are involved with technology or not.</li>
          <li>First, you'll need to download Python to your computer. If you don't already have it downloaded, consult the course notes in the resources section of this section.</li>
          <li>One thing you should know, is that when downloading, you should download the python 3 interpreter, so Python 3.<i>whatever the current python is at the time of reading this</i>.</li>
          <li>There are 2 possible things being referenced when the word "python" is being used. The first is the language, which is the syntax used to give your computer instructions. The seconds, is the interpreter, which for Python
            will be referred to as the IDLE window. The interpreter allows you to run python code and perform the tasks you asked your computer to complete.
          </li>
          <li>One thing to keep in mind is that programming can be complicated, and no one remeber all the things they need to remember. This leads to a lot of googling on certain topics,
              so there should be no shame in not knowing one little thing about a concept.
          </li>
          <li>If you do have an error message pop up while you're trying to run any of your code, copy and paste the error message into your preferred search engine. In all likelihood, the first few results will be from a website
            called Stack Overflow, which is a great forum for any problems you might have while coding. Always make sure to check to make sure someone with your exact problem hasn't posed the question before you post.

        </ul>

        <h3>Lesson Two: Basic Terminology and using IDLE</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>There are 2 ways to write Python code. There is the shell, which allows you to test different functions and things you can do in Python.
              Then there is the file editor, which allows you to write programs, which give your computer instructions on what to do and how to handle certain types of input.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Expressions:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>An expression is a mix of values and operators.</li>
          <li>2 + 2, is an expression because it consists of values (2), and operators (+).</li>
          <li>Python does follow order of operations, so you can input parenthesis to make the computer do addition or subtraction before it does any mulitplication or division.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Data Types:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Every value has a data type, but it cannot have more than one data type.</li>
          <ol>
            <li>Values such as "2", are called integers</li>
            <li>Integers with a decimal at the end are called floating point numbers, or more commonly, just floats</li>
            <li>Letters and words are called strings. You must wrap strings in single or double quotes so that Python knows where the text begins and ends.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>There are 2 expressions you can do with strings.</li>
              <li>The first is string concatenation, and that uses the plus operator. You can use it to add strings together, just make sure that if you want a space inbetween your concatenated strings,
                  you add one in either of the strings you're adding.
              </li>
              <li>The second is String Replication, which uses the mulitplication operator. You can use this to repeat a string a certain amount of times.</li>
            </ul>
          </ol>
        </ul>
        <h4>Variables:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Your prgram can save values to your commputer's memory with variables.</li>
          <li>A variable is like a container that can store a value, like 2, or even 2 + 2.</li>
          <li>You can create a variable by making an assignment statement, which looks like "spam = 420".</li>
          <li>You can use a variable name in place of any operators. If you were to type spam into the shell window, it would spit out the number 420, because that's what spam evaluates to.</li>
          <li>You can also update variable by rewriting the assignment statement with the name of the variable you want to update.</li>
          <li>For instance, you could update spam to equal "hello". Now you can concatenate this variable to the string " world". Don't forget the space in the middle, or the shell would output "helloworld".</li>
          <li>Updating the variable is also known as overriding </li>
          <li>If an instruction evaluates to a single value, it's an expression, and if it doesn't, its a statement.</li>
        </ul>
