        <h3>Lesson Twenty-Three: Regular Expression Basics</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Text and pattern recognition, similar to the find and replace functions of a Word document are very common concepts needed for programs. The problem is that making this pattern recognition can be
              incredibly lengthy. Regular expressions can be very useful to save time instead of writing out a whole bunch of code for your specific situation. I won't show it here, but I encourage you to check
              out the lesson to see how large the program is just to recognize a phone number in a string.
          </li>
          <li>So here I will provide a step-by-step guide that follows along with the lesson and show you how to use regular expressions. First thing you'll want to do is import the re (regular expressions)
              module at the top of your file.
          </li>
          <li>For the next step make a variable named "phoneNumRegex", and store "re.compile(r'\d\d\d-\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d')". The compile function goes through and creates an object and places in things that match what you're
              searching for. Inside the parenthesis we use a raw string, which is like a string, but it does not adhere to the escape characters due to the large amount of slashes used within raw strings. Inside the raw
              string, we use '\d' to identify that we're searching for digits, and we also use the dash character to display where we expect to see a dash inside of a phone number.
          </li>
          <li>On the next line we can use the .search() function to search a string for the pattern we just made. We can search a simple string, and store it in a variable called message, here's one you can copy-paste:
              'Call me at 415-555-1011 tomorrow, or at 415-555-9999 on my office line'. Now just input the message variable inside the .search() function. The phoneNumRegex variable should precede the .search() function.
          </li>
          <li>The search function will output a match object, so you can store the previous line in a variable called mo. On the next line, we can use the .group() function which outputs text of whatever's inside of the
              match object. For this line we can use the print function and inside type 'mo.group()'. When run, this will display only the first phone number in the example string.
          </li>
          <li>To find all of the phone numbers in the string, you can replace the search function with the findall function, which displays all the results in a list value. You can also replace the message variable inside
              the findall function with the string if you'd like.
          </li>
          <li>Here's the final program written out, just to show how much simpler it is to use regular expressions (if you checked out the original program within the lesson):<br>'import re<br><br> phoneNumRegex =
              re.compile(r'\d\d\d-\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d')<br>print(phoneNumRegex.findall('Call me at 415-555-1011 tomorrow, or at 415-555-9999 for my office line'))'.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        <h3>Lesson Twenty-Four: Regex Groups and the Pipe Character</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>You can separate parts of the pattern you're searching for by using parenthesis when setting up the pattern using the .compile() function. This separation is known as 
              creating a group.
          </li>
          <li>For instance, if you wanted to create a group of just the area code, and also group the rest of the phone number in another  group, you could do so by typing: 
              "phoneNumRegex = re.compile(r'(\d\d\d)-(\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d)')".
          </li>
          <li>Now if you store the search function call in a matched object varible, you can use the group function to access just the important parts of the matched object. Here's 
              an example: "mo = phoneNumRegex.search('My number is 415-555-4242')<br>mo.group(1)<br>mo.group(2)<br>mo.group()".
          </li>
          <li>The results for mo.group(1) should be just the area code of the phone number, mo.group(2) should be the rest of the phone number, and mo.group should be the whole thing.</li>
          <li>If you need to search for a literal parenthesis, you can write a compile statement that looks like this: "phoneNumRegex = re.compile(r'\(\d\d\d\) \d\d\d-\d\d\d\d')". 
              Here, we just escaped the parethesis by adding a backslash before it.
          </li>
          <li>You can use the pipe character, "|", found above the enter key to specify a prefix to a word, and then provide possible endings to the word.</li>
          <li>Say you wanted to find anything related to Batman using a regular expression. You could do this by writing a compile statement that looks like this: 
              "batRegex = re.compile(r'Bat(man|mobile|copter)')<br>mo = batRegex.search('Batmobile lost a wheel')<br>mo.group()".<br> The mo.group() would return "Batmobile".</li>
        </ul>
