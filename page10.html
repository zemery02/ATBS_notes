      <h2>Section Ten: Regular Expressions</h2>
      <div id="L23">
        <h3>Lesson Twenty-Three: Regular Expression Basics</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Text and pattern recognition, similar to the find and replace functions of a Word document are very common concepts needed for programs. The problem is that making this pattern recognition can be
              incredibly lengthy. Regular expressions can be very useful to save time instead of writing out a whole bunch of code for your specific situation. I won't show it here, but I encourage you to check
              out the lesson to see how large the program is just to recognize a phone number in a string.
          </li>
          <li>So here I will provide a step-by-step guide that follows along with the lesson and show you how to use regular expressions. First thing you'll want to do is import the re (regular expressions)
              module at the top of your file.
          </li>
          <li>For the next step make a variable named "phoneNumRegex", and store "re.compile(r'\d\d\d-\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d')". The compile function goes through and creates an object and places in things that match what you're
              searching for. Inside the parenthesis we use a raw string, which is like a string, but it does not adhere to the escape characters due to the large amount of slashes used within raw strings. Inside the raw
              string, we use '\d' to identify that we're searching for digits, and we also use the dash character to display where we expect to see a dash inside of a phone number.
          </li>
          <li>On the next line we can use the .search() function to search a string for the pattern we just made. We can search a simple string, and store it in a variable called message, here's one you can copy-paste:
              'Call me at 415-555-1011 tomorrow, or at 415-555-9999 on my office line'. Now just input the message variable inside the .search() function. The phoneNumRegex variable should precede the .search() function.
          </li>
          <li>The search function will output a match object, so you can store the previous line in a variable called mo. On the next line, we can use the .group() function which outputs text of whatever's inside of the
              match object. For this line we can use the print function and inside type 'mo.group()'. When run, this will display only the first phone number in the example string.
          </li>
          <li>To find all of the phone numbers in the string, you can replace the search function with the findall function, which displays all the results in a list value. You can also replace the message variable inside
              the findall function with the string if you'd like.
          </li>
          <li>Here's the final program written out, just to show how much simpler it is to use regular expressions (if you checked out the original program within the lesson):<br>'import re<br><br> phoneNumRegex =
              re.compile(r'\d\d\d-\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d')<br>print(phoneNumRegex.findall('Call me at 415-555-1011 tomorrow, or at 415-555-9999 for my office line'))'.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="L24">
        <h3>Lesson Twenty-Four: Regex Groups and the Pipe Character</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>You can separate parts of the pattern you're searching for by using parenthesis when setting up the pattern using the .compile() function. This separation is known as 
              creating a group.
          </li>
          <li>For instance, if you wanted to create a group of just the area code, and also group the rest of the phone number in another  group, you could do so by typing: 
              "phoneNumRegex = re.compile(r'(\d\d\d)-(\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d)')".
          </li>
          <li>Now if you store the search function call in a matched object varible, you can use the group function to access just the important parts of the matched object. Here's 
              an example: "mo = phoneNumRegex.search('My number is 415-555-4242')<br>mo.group(1)<br>mo.group(2)<br>mo.group()".
          </li>
          <li>The results for mo.group(1) should be just the area code of the phone number, mo.group(2) should be the rest of the phone number, and mo.group should be the whole thing.</li>
          <li>If you need to search for a literal parenthesis, you can write a compile statement that looks like this: "phoneNumRegex = re.compile(r'\(\d\d\d\) \d\d\d-\d\d\d\d')". 
              Here, we just escaped the parethesis by adding a backslash before it.
          </li>
          <li>You can use the pipe character, "|", found above the enter key to specify a prefix to a word, and then provide possible endings to the word.</li>
          <li>Say you wanted to find anything related to Batman using a regular expression. You could do this by writing a compile statement that looks like this: 
              "batRegex = re.compile(r'Bat(man|mobile|copter)')<br>mo = batRegex.search('Batmobile lost a wheel')<br>mo.group()".<br> The mo.group() would return "Batmobile".</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="L25">
        <h3>Lesson Twenty-Five: Repetition in Regex Patterns and Greedy/Nongreedy Matching</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>We can use the question mark character to find zero or one repetitions within a pattern we want to match. Here's an example where we look for the word Batman, or 
              Batwoman:<br>"batRegex = re.compile(r'Bat(wo)?man')<br>mo = batRegex.search("The Adventures of Batman")<br>mo.group()"<br> This will output the string "Batman".
          </li>
          <li>In that last example, if you replaced Batman with Batwoman, it would still return Batwoman, but it would not return anything if you had more than one instance of 
              "wo" before "man". For example, if you searched "The adventures of Batwowowowoman" it would not return anything.
          </li>
          <li>You can use this question mark to make things like area codes optional if you made made a regex object to search for phone numbers. If you ever need to literally 
              use a question mark while trying to match a pattern, you can use a backslash before the question mark.
          </li>
          <li>You can also use an asterisk, or what is known as a star in regular expressions, to find zero or more matches in a pattern. For example, if we swapped out the 
              question mark for a star in the batRegex example a few points ago, it would match a string like "Batwowowowowowowowowwoman" because there's zero or more instances of 
              "wo" before "man". If you need to match a literal star, you can also escape the star with a backslash before it as well. 
          </li>
          <li>There's also the plus character, which means that you whatever group you're trying to match must appear at least once, but it can appear more than that as well. Going 
              back to the batRegex example from before, searching "the adventures of Batman" would now return false because there isn't an instance of "wo" before "man". If you need 
              to match a literal plus sign, you can use a backslah beforehand to do so. 
          </li>
          <li>If you want to match a specific number of instances of a repetition in a pattern, you can do so by inserting the number in a pair of curly braces after the group you'd 
              like match in a pattern. For example, you could write something like:<br>"haRegex = re.compile(r'(Ha) {3}')<br>mo = haRegex.search('He said "HaHaHa"')<br>mo.group()". This 
              will result in a match of "HaHaHa", but if there was one more or less instances of "Ha" it wouldn't return anything.
          </li>
          <li>You can also have a second number in the curly braces, separated by a comma, to represent at least x, at most y. Using the haRegex object from before we could change the 
              compile statement to look like: "haRegex = (r'(Ha) {3,5}')". Now we can match a string that has at least 3 "Ha"s, but it could also go up and including 5 "Ha"s.
          </li>
          <li>Just like slices, you can leave one side of the comma blank so as to leave it going forever in that direction. So if you left the left side blank, so it looks like: {, 5}, 
              it would match 0-5 instances of whatever you were searching for. And if you left the right side blank, it would have at least x instances or more. So {3,} would match anything 
              with 3 or more instances of whatever you were searching for.
          </li>
          <li>If you were to write a compile statement that looks like: (r'(\d){3,5}'), and searched the string '1234567890', it would match the string "12345". This is because if 
              left unspecified, Python will try and match the first string that matches, with the highest number of instances available. This is known as Greedy matching.
          </li>
          <li>You can get a Nongreedy match if you simply put a question mark after your curly braces. Now if you use the same compile statement as above and search the same string
              as above, it will return "123" because it was the first and quickest available match.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Lesson Twenty-Six: Regex Character Classes and the findall() Method</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Just to set up this lesson, you might want to open the IDLE window, import the Regex module, and make a compile statement to match a phone number, as shown in the final
            point in lesson 23. 
          </li>
          <li>In previous lessons, we used the .search() method to find the first match for a string.</li>
          <li>Instead, we can use the .findall() method to well, find all the matches in any given string. This can be helpful for skimming large passages of text for certain things, 
              like a phone number for instance. 
          </li>
          <li>One interesting thing about the .findall() method is that unlike the .search method, which returns a match object data type, the .findall() method returns a list data type.</li>
          <li>If you happen to use groups for your compile statement, using the .findall() method will result in a list of tuples being returned. For example, if you grouped the phone 
              number compile statement by the area code and the rest of the phone number, the .findall() method would return a list with a tuple, where the area code would be one string item
              inside, and the rest of the number would be another string item inside.
          </li>
          <li>You can also have groups inside of groups, so you could always have a phoneRegex with the area code, and the main number, and then you could surround the whole thing with 
              parenthesis. Using the .findall() method would result in a tuple with the area code, the main number, and the entire number. 
          </li>
          <li>We've already learned a little bit about character classes before, without even knowing it! the \d that we've been using for the phone number regex is known as a digit 
              class, and it can be used to find any digit in a string. 
          </li>
          <li>Now, in this lesson, we will learn all about the other types of character classes we can use for Regex compile statements.
            <ul>
              <li>The first one that was already mentioned and had been used and explained, is "\d" which is used to match any numeric digit from 0 to 9.</li>
              <li>The second one we'll talk about is "\D" which is used to match anything that is <i>not</i> a numeric digit from 0 to 9.</li>
              <li>The third class is "\w" which is known to match "word characters". This class is used to match any letter, numeric digit, or the underscore character. It does not match
                  things like punction, or space characters.
              </li>
              <li>The next one is "\W", which is anything that is <i>not</i> a letter, numeric digit, or underscore character.</li>
              <li>The final set of character classes starts off with "\s", which is used to match any space, tab, or newline characters.</li>
              <li>And finally we have "\S" which is used to match anything that is <i>not</i> a space, tab, or newline character.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>We can use this new knowledge to to practice with an example. One thing you should do before you get started with this practice problem is store these lyrics in a variable: 
              '12 drummers drumming, 11 pipers piping, 10 lords a leaping, 9 ladies dancing, 8 maids a milking, 7 swans a swimming, 6 geese a laying, 5 golden rings, 4 calling birds, 
               3 french hens, 2 turtle doves, and 1 partridge in a pear tree'
          </li>
          <li>Now, we can write a compile statement that looks for each day's number, and 1 word following it. The compile statement looks like this: "xmasRegex = re.compile(r'\d+\s\w+')"</li>
          <li>To start this off we use the digit class to look for one or more digits, because we have double <i>and</i> single digit numbers that we're looking for. For the next step, 
              we use the space character because there's a space between the digit(s) and the word. Then we use the \w, or the word character to find one or more letter, digit, or underscore 
              charcter. 
          </li>
          <li>Using the .findall() method will return a list with the day, and the first word following the digit(s) of the day.</li>
          <li>You can also create your own character classes, and the next few points will show you just how to do that.</li>
          <li>To create your own character class, you'll want to store your compile statement string inside of square brackets. So for instance, we can create a compile statement that searches 
              for vowels that looks like: "vowelRegex = re.compile(r'[aeiou]')".
          </li>
          <li>You can also use dashes inside the brackets to have a shorter list of letters. So if you wanted all lower case a through z in your character class, you could simply use "[a-z]".</li>
          <li>You can also use curly braces besides the brackets to specify a number of repetitions. For instance if you wanted to find vowels that were right next to each other, you could 
              write "re.compile(r'[aeiouAEIOU]{2}')". Now words like "eat" and "food" would return the strings 'ea' and 'oo' when passed through the .findall() method.
          </li>
          <li>You can also make what is known as a negative character class, which is where you insert things that are not supposed to match when passed through the .findall() method.</li>
          <li>To do this you can simply put a carrot, "^", symbol right inside your brackets, before you type anything else. For instance if you wanted something that looked for consonants, 
              numeric digits and other characters, you could write a compile statement that looks like this: "re.compile(r'[^aeiouAEIOU]')".
          </li>
        </ul>
