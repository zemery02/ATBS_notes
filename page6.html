      <div id="L13">
        <h3>Lesson Thirteen: The List Data Type</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>A list is a value that contains values. The values it stores are stored in an ordered sequence. The values it stores are often referred to as items.</li>
          <li>Just like a string that begins and ends with quotes, a list begins and ends with square brackets, "[]".</li>
          <li>The items in the list are separted by commas, which is known as being "comma-delimited".</li>
          <li>An example for a list could look like this: "['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']". When this is entered into the IDLE window, it will return everything you typed, still inside brackets and quotes.</li>
          <li>You can of course stores lists inside of a variable, and when typed in the IDLE window, it returns the list just as it would if you typed the full contents of whatever is stored inside the variable.</li>
          <li>To access a specific item, or "index", of a list, you use the name of the variable, followed by square brackets and the number of the item, using zero-based indexing.</li>
          <li>For example, you could have "spam = ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']", and then in the next line, write spam[0], and it would return 'cat'.</li>
          <li>You can also have a list inside of another list. You could write spam1 = [['cat', 'bat'], [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]]. If you entered "spam[0]" it would return the entire first list that contains 'cat' and 'bat'.</li>
          <li>To access an item in a list inside of another list, you just write another index, so if you wanted to just print 'bat', from the last example, you would write "spam[0][1]", and it would return 'bat'.</li>
          <li>You can also use negative indexes to count backwards in a list. The -1 index is the last item in the list, and -2 is the next to last item, and so on.</li>
          <li>You can also use indexes just as you would a normal variable. You could concatenate a string to say that "The elephant is afraid of the bat", by using spam and writing
              "print('The ' + spam[-1] + ' is afraid of the' + spam[1] + '.')".
          </li>
          <li>You can grab multiple list items at once by using a "slice", as opposed to an index.</li>
          <li>A slice is also between square brackets, and the starting and ending place is separated by a colon. So if you were to type "spam[1:3]" it would result in an output of ['bat', 'rat'], because slices go
              up to, but not include the ending number.
          </li>
          <li>Just as you can reassign data inside of a variable, you can also use indexing to reassign data inside of a list. To do this, just type "<i>variablename[desiredindex] = desireddata</i>".</li>
          <li>You can also use slices to reassign data in a list.</li>
          <li>You can omit the starting number of a slice if you want to start at index 0. You can do the same with the ending number if you want to go until the end of the list.</li>
          <li>The del statement is used to delete items from a list. Just use the "del" keyword, followed by the index or slice that you want to remove from the list. You can think of the del statement as the
              opposite to the assign statement.
          </li>
          <li>There are many similarities between strings and lists, in fact, here are some examples:
            <ol>
              <li>You can pass in a list to the len function, and it will return the number of items in a list.</li>
              <li>You can concatenate lists using the plus operator. So if you have 2 lists that contain, [1, 2, 3], and [4, 5, 6], it would combine to be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].</li>
              <li>You can also replicate items in a list using "*". If you wrote "[1, 2, 3] * 2" in the IDLE window, it would have an output of [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3].</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>There is a list function that lets you pass in a string, and returns a list with each of the letters in the string as a single item in the list.</li>
          <li>You can use the in and not in statements to check if a value is inside of a list. To do this, write the value you are looking for, followed by the in, or not in keyword, and then the list that you want
              to be checked. This evaluates to True of False based on the outcome of the statement.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Lesson Fourteen: for Loops with Lists, Multiple Assignment, and Augmented Operators</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Python considers the range object that spits out when you use the range function in the IDLE window to be very similar to a list. In fact, you can replace the range keyword in a for loop with a list if
              you really wanted to.
          </li>
          <li>You can actually pass in the range function into the list function and it would output a list that spells out the range functions output. For example, you could write "list(range(4))", into the IDLE
              window, and the output would be "[0, 1, 2, 3]".
          </li>
          <li>This can be helpful for making big lists. Say you want to have a list that counts by 2, starting at 0, and ending at 100, you could pass in "range(0, 100, 2)" into the list function and it would give
              you exactly what you need way faster than you could ever type it out.
          </li>
          <li>Another thing that is common is to pass in the len function into the range function. For instance, if you had a for loop, and a variable with a list, you could have the range function go by the the
              amount of items in the vairable length.This can come in handy if you ever need to use the i variable for the index of a list, as well as where exactly you are in the loop. To use the variable i
              for the index of the list, just use the name of the list variable, followed by "i" in squarebrackets. If you ever need to see what is happening at what point in the loop, you can just pass the i
              variable into the str function as you formulate a print statement.
          </li>
          <li>If you have a large list, and you need to assign each item in the list to a variable, Python makes it easy by allowing you to assign multiple variables to one single list. For example, you could
              have a list variable named dog that looks like this: ['loyal', 'wholesome', 'cute']. You can assign each of those items to a variable by simply typing "bestTrait, disposition, looks = dog".
          </li>
          <li>You can also use multiple value on the right side of the assignment statement, it does not just have to be a list for Python to iterate through.</li>
          <li>This can be used for "variable swapping", which is when you have 2 predefined variables and you need to swap the values inside of them. If you have 2 variables called "a" and "b", you could simply write
              the statement "a, b = b, a".
          </li>
          <li>The last Python shortcut we'll go over in this lesson is the augmented assignment operator. When coding, it is very common to want to reassign a variable based on it's past value. For instance,
              if you just want to add one to a variable, you can do that by typing "<i>variablename = variablename</i> + 1". With augmented assignment operators, you don't need to type the variable name twice, instead
              you can just write "<i>variable name</i> += 1", and it will do the same exact thing.
          </li>
          <li>You can use the augmented assignment operators with the addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and the modulous operators.</li>
