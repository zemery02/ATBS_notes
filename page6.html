        <h3>Lesson Thirteen: The List Data Type</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>A list is a value that contains values. The values it stores are stored in an ordered sequence. The values it stores are often referred to as items.</li>
          <li>Just like a string that begins and ends with quotes, a list begins and ends with square brackets, "[]".</li>
          <li>The items in the list are separted by commas, which is known as being "comma-delimited".</li>
          <li>An example for a list could look like this: "['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']". When this is entered into the IDLE window, it will return everything you typed, still inside brackets and quotes.</li>
          <li>You can of course stores lists inside of a variable, and when typed in the IDLE window, it returns the list just as it would if you typed the full contents of whatever is stored inside the variable.</li>
          <li>To access a specific item, or "index", of a list, you use the name of the variable, followed by square brackets and the number of the item, using zero-based indexing.</li>
          <li>For example, you could have "spam = ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']", and then in the next line, write spam[0], and it would return 'cat'.</li>
          <li>You can also have a list inside of another list. You could write spam1 = [['cat', 'bat'], [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]]. If you entered "spam[0]" it would return the entire first list that contains 'cat' and 'bat'.</li>
          <li>To access an item in a list inside of another list, you just write another index, so if you wanted to just print 'bat', from the last example, you would write "spam[0][1]", and it would return 'bat'.</li>
          <li>You can also use negative indexes to count backwards in a list. The -1 index is the last item in the list, and -2 is the next to last item, and so on.</li>
          <li>You can also use indexes just as you would a normal variable. You could concatenate a string to say that "The elephant is afraid of the bat", by using spam and writing
              "print('The ' + spam[-1] + ' is afraid of the' + spam[1] + '.')".
          </li>
          <li>You can grab multiple list items at once by using a "slice", as opposed to an index.</li>
          <li>A slice is also between square brackets, and the starting and ending place is separated by a colon. So if you were to type "spam[1:3]" it would result in an output of ['bat', 'rat'], because slices go
              up to, but not include the ending number.
          </li>
          <li>Just as you can reassign data inside of a variable, you can also use indexing to reassign data inside of a list. To do this, just type "<i>variablename[desiredindex] = desireddata</i>".</li>
          <li>You can also use slices to reassign data in a list.</li>
          <li>You can omit the starting number of a slice if you want to start at index 0. You can do the same with the ending number if you want to go until the end of the list.</li>
          <li>The del statement is used to delete items from a list. Just use the "del" keyword, followed by the index or slice that you want to remove from the list. You can think of the del statement as the
              opposite to the assign statement.
          </li>
          <li>There are many similarities between strings and lists, in fact, here are some examples:
            <ol>
              <li>You can pass in a list to the len function, and it will return the number of items in a list.</li>
              <li>You can concatenate lists using the plus operator. So if you have 2 lists that contain, [1, 2, 3], and [4, 5, 6], it would combine to be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].</li>
              <li>You can also replicate items in a list using "*". If you wrote "[1, 2, 3] * 2" in the IDLE window, it would have an output of [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3].</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>There is a list function that lets you pass in a string, and returns a list with each of the letters in the string as a single item in the list.</li>
          <li>You can use the in and not in statements to check if a value is inside of a list. To do this, write the value you are looking for, followed by the in, or not in keyword, and then the list that you want
              to be checked. This evaluates to True of False based on the outcome of the statement.
          </li>
